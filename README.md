## Background
Small fish have a habit of gathering into very large groups. They do this for a Multitude of benefits, one of them being that as a group each individual member has a higher chance of surviving an attack from a predator.

The fish do not do this as a conscious cooperation but instead each fish acts independently and only cares for its own survival. This independent form of accidental cooperation is a behavior best simulated with boids. 

Boids are simulated actors that when in masses are able to achieve complex results but where each individual actor is independent with a relatively simple artificial intelligence.

## Problem Description
Create a boid simulation of schooling fish and predator fish. When a predator fish moves through a school each individual fish in its proximity avoid it without intersecting other fishes. How well can an individual fish in a school avoid a predator in a computer simulation?


## Technical Description

A set number of boid fishes are spawned at the beginning of a simulation. Each schooling boid fish follows a set of 4 rules.

- Attempts to keep a reasonable distance from other fish to not collide.
- In the proximity of another fish or school tries to move towards the average position of the school.
- Each fish in a school attempts to keep the same direction and speed of the school.
- Each fish attempts to keep a safe distance from a predator actor.


A predator actor exist in the simulation. The predator actor follows the mouse pointer and its speed can be increased or decreased. If the predator intersects with a fish it displays this by setting the fish it intersected with to some new color.

The simulation is to be in real time from a 2D top-down perspective with actor fishes being different colored shapes to differentiate schooling fish from fish in a school from predator fish.
